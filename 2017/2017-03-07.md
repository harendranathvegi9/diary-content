I was struggling to change location of the script of one of my pm2 processes, since I'm not using a configuration file and the docs seemed to say nothing about this.
So here's what I ended up doing:

```bash
pm2 stop myprocess
pm2 delete myprocess
pm2 start /var/www/myprocess --name="myprocess"
pm2 save
```
