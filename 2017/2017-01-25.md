# irony and cynicism


no truth which will explain everything

self-referentiality, moral relativism, cynicism, irony, irreverence, narcissism

> this is because irony, entertaining as it is, serves an exclusively negative function. it's critical and destructive, a ground-clearing.


- "it's all socially constructed" 
- "there are no absolute truths" 
- "nobody understands this like I do" 
- "only my perspective matters"
- "but also, nothing matters"
- "i just want to have fun"


cynicism <-> sincerity
