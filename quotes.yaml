    Whenever we start, there’s an idea that we have to search for content first. 
    What will we draw or write? I have a feeling that it isn’t about researching or 
    Googling stuff—for me, it’s about removing all of the ideas that are in the way 
    of my thinking.
    
    How do you remove those layers, those walls? I draw them out of the way. The 
    things I draw aren’t only the things I want to draw—they’re the things I’m 
    getting out of the way. That concept is about understating that, as creative 
    people, we feel like everything we do is shit, but that’s because there’s stuff 
    in the way—and that’s a good thing to recognize. If we never start, or if we 
    pause because the work sucks, those things are still in the way. We have to 
    keep going to get past them."
