## FantasyLand spec

Algebraic data types. Implementations includes ramda-fantasy and folktale.

## Maybe Monad

```javascript
if(Maybe.of(obj.prop)) {
  doSomethingWith(obj.prop) 
  // won't throw if obj is undefined (no need for error handling or weird if forks!)
}
```

## Angular services

Can't import them in action creators (they won't have their dependencies injected)
