## async effects workflow in ngredux

calculate data that is derived from a particular side effect (http call for example) 
in the action creator that gets executed when the side effect returns.

ie: 
```javascript
// component.js
import {received} from './actions'
service.fetchData().then(response => dispatch(receive(response)))

// service.js
fetchData = () => 
  dispatch => 
    Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      dispatch({type: fetched })
      fetch('/api', {}).then(response => resolve(response))
    
// actions.js
export function receive (res) {
  // do something with res here
  const transformed = res
  return {
    type: received, 
    payload: { data: transformed } 
  }
}
```
